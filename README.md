Project description 

1.In this project, we twist the problem of path planning a little bit just to give you the opportunity to deepen your understanding of search
algorithms by modifying search techniques to fit the criteria of a realistic problem. To give you a realistic context for expanding your 
ideas about search algorithms, we invite you to take part in a Mars exploration mission. The goal of this mission is to send a sophisticated
mobile lab to Mars to study the surface of the planet more closely. We are invited to develop an algorithm to find the optimal path for
navigation of the rover based on a particular objective.

Search for the optimal paths  
Our task is to move the rover from its landing site to one of the target sites for experiments and soil sampling. For an ideal rover that 
can cross every place, usually the shortest geometrical path is defined as the optimal path; however, since in this project we have some 
operational concerns, our objective is first to avoid steep areas and thus we want to minimize the path from A to B under those constraints.
Thus, our goal is, roughly, finding the shortest path among the safe paths. What defines the safety of a path is the maximum slope between 
any two adjacent cells along that path.

2.In this project, we will play the game of Halma, an adversarial game with some similarities to checkers. The game uses a 16x16 checkered gameboard. Each player starts with 19 game pieces clustered in diagonally opposite corners of the board. To win the game, a player needs to transfer all of their pieces from their starting corner to the opposite corner, into the positions that were initially occupied by the opponent. Note that this original rule of the game is subject to spoiling, as a player may choose to not move some pieces at all, thereby preventing the opponent from occupying those locations. Note that the spoiling player cannot win either (because some pieces remain in their original corner and thus cannot be used to occupy all positions in the opposite corner). Here, to prevent spoiling, we modify the goal of the game to be to occupy all of the opponentâ€™s starting positions which the opponent is not still occupying. See http://www.cyningstan.com/post/922/unspoiling-halma for more about this rule modification.

3. RipeApe  pharmacy  is  developing  a  self-service  automated  system  to  alert  customers  about potential drug interactions for both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Many medications should not be taken together or should not be taken if a patient has certain symptoms and allergies. Evaluating all the criteria for whether a patient can take a particular medication requires the patient's medical history and expert knowledge from a health care provider. The system, however, can provide an instant guideline to keep patients informed and minimize the risks. 

You will use first-order logic resolutionto solve this problem.
